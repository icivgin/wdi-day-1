I bet a lot of people are going to say this, but I don't really have a passion project in mind just yet. However, I could make an educated guess. I'm interested in photography, music, writing, outdoor sports, and marketing, so it would likely be a product having to do with one of those things. I like the idea of connecting people live, maybe you could log on and write a story with a friend or a stranger. Maybe it could be a social network for climbers (to help you meet new climbers and coordinate). I know that once I have a better understanding of the tools I'll be working with, I'll be more able to answer this.

Live and colaborative novel writing.
Climber/mtb social network for meetups (bettter than all the sub-par alternatives that already exist).
